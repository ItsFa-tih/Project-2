Overview -
In this project,  we will evaluate performance of different machine learning algorithms based on the same data set.  We have sourced the data set from https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn.  

The project will consist of :  

1- Data preperation, normalization and encoding - Hadil 
2- Training, predicting and evaluating with model #1 : Neural Networks - Tommy
3- Training, predicting and evaluating with model #2 : Logistic Regression -Fatih
4- Training, predicting and evaluating with model #3 : Nearest Neighbors - Juan

Every model will be optimized and their performance metrics will be compared. 

Our findings will be presented on Thursday Feb17
